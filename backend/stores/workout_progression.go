// CreateWorkoutWithProgression creates a workout and, if it came from a routine,
// stages auto-progression suggestions (issue #40) for the sets the user beat — all in
// ONE transaction.
//
// The PR-snapshot read (what's the current best for each exercise), the workout
// insert, and the suggestion-staging write used to run as separate transactions
// (snapshot read → Workout.Create → progressRoutine/SuggestTargets). Two concurrent
// workout submissions for the same exercise could both read the identical "prior
// best" before either committed, so both could get flagged suggested_is_pr = true
// even though only the one that actually committed last was the genuine all-time
// best. Reading the prior best and staging the suggestion inside the same
// transaction as the insert lets SQLite's writer-serialization close that race: a
// concurrent commit landing between this transaction's snapshot read and its own
// commit now fails this transaction outright (surfaced as a DB error) rather than
// silently persisting a wrong PR flag.
//
// Suggestion-staging stays best-effort: if it errors, the error is logged and
// dropped so the already-inserted workout still commits — never fail a save the
// user is waiting on because routine bookkeeping hiccuped. Its (possibly partial)
// writes are rolled back via a SAVEPOINT rather than left committed, so "dropped"
// stays true even now that staging shares a transaction with the insert.
//
// This does widen the critical section: with db.DB.SetMaxOpenConns(1), the whole
// PR-snapshot + insert + suggestion-staging sequence now holds the process's one
// connection for its full duration instead of releasing it between the three
// steps. That's an accepted tradeoff for closing the TOCTOU race above — the race
// specifically requires the snapshot read and the dependent write to be
// serialized — not an oversight. Exercises and Sets each independently capping at
// max=500 (models.go) does NOT bound that widened section, since it bounds each
// dimension separately, not their product — the actual bound is the total-sets
// struct-level validation (models.MaxWorkoutSets, enforced in
// controllers/workouts.go's init()), which caps sum(len(Exercises[i].Sets)) across
// the whole request.
